## Codex-reliability Binary

The `Codex-reliability` binary for this project is located at:

    .Codex-reliability/bin/Codex-reliability

Always use this path when running commands. Do NOT use bare `Codex-reliability`,
do NOT use paths containing `~/.Codex-reliability/`, and do NOT use `$PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR`
or any other variable to construct the path.

Example usage:

    .Codex-reliability/bin/Codex-reliability work list
    .Codex-reliability/bin/Codex-reliability work next
    .Codex-reliability/bin/Codex-reliability work on <id>
    .Codex-reliability/bin/Codex-reliability work update <id> --status complete
